			<h2>Intro</h2>		
		<p>Welcome to EdinCoder! To complete this course you'll need the following:</p>		
					<ul>
							<li >
										A computer with a web browser (preferably Google Chrome)
									</li>
								<li >
					<a href="https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free">						
										An account on CodePen.io (click here to sign up for free)
					</a>				</li>
								<li >
										An open mind and willingness to Google!
									</li>
						</ul>
		<p>The general idea of this is that we're going to be working together to create personalised versions of a few pre-made web page ideas, building them up step by step and learning how the code works at each level.</p>		
			<h2>What / How</h2>		
		<p>We've broken this course down into levels, where each level assumes you're starting with code from the previous level, and builds upon what you've learned so far. As such, you should start at Level 1 and proceed through the levels in order; as you progress you'll quickly get to more challenging tasks.</p><p>Each level will specify the objectives of that level, and will show you a screenshot of our example app after completing that level. This is just to give you an idea of what to aim for - your version will have your own content and any personal style choices you choose to make!</p><p>Within each level there are a number of <b>steps</b>, with instructions and another screenshot of our example app for each. By default, only the instruction text is shown; this will often contain technical or semi-technical hints about how to achieve that step, as pointers of what you'll need to Google.</p><p>If you're struggling to understand what you need to do for a step and Google isn't helping, you've got a few options:</p><ul><li>Firstly, click the second tab for that step to show the "Code Outline" - this will vary in helpfulness for different steps, but the idea is that this should give you <i>a bit of help</i>, but without giving you the complete code needed for the step.</li><li>Secondly, try and get the attention of one of the EdinCoder staff team to help out, or ask a fellow learner in case they can help!</li><li>As last resort if nobody is free to help and you're keen to move onto the next step, you can click on the third tab to see the code we wrote for this step in the example app.</li></ul>
