			<h3>Course</h3>		
		<p><em>"Learning to code is the single best thing anyone can do to get the most out of the amazing future in front of us." </em><em>- Marc Andreessen</em></p><p>The course we've built is designed to be used as learning material for a short (~2 hours) workshop run by the edincoder team.</p><p>No programming experience is required, and nothing but a web browser is needed. Starting with Level 1, we will guide you through the process of building your own webpage, using online code editor <b>Codepen</b> to write code and immediately see the results.</p><p>Along with teaching you how the basics of the web work, we're also trying to teach you <i>how to learn by yourself.</i> One of the great things about software development is that there is a huge amount of free, high quality documentation and learning material available online, so rather than telling you exactly what to do, we give you hints and expect you to Google for the specifics you need for each step!</p><p>At the end of the workshop, we'll give you a handout with credentials for your own bit of webspace; a place to host your own website so it's online on the internet and accessible to the world. We'll then show you how to upload the code you've written in Codepen to this webspace, so you can show off your creation!</p>

			<h3>About Us</h3>		
		<p>We're a small team of developers based in Edinburgh who believe <b>anybody</b> can learn to code and go on to become a professional Software Engineer, regardless of background, experience, education, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity or age.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tech industry still has a long way to go, with recent reports showing big players such as Facebook and Google still employ only 15% women and less than 5% people of colour.</p><p>The only way this is going to change is if we're proactive - rather than blaming the education system, or pointing the finger somewhere else, let's get out there and teach the next generation that coding is fun, rewarding and a great career choice for all!</p><p>We want to get people <i>excited</i> about technology, <i>empower</i> them with self-confidence, and give them all of the tools and resources they need to learn programming. That's all it takes - the software industry is merit-based, so as long as you can do the job, you'll get a job!</p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfBWk4nw440
